# PROJECT NAME

Weekend To-Do List

## Description

_Duration: 3 Days_

For our week 8 weekend challenge, we were given the task to develop a to-do list to collect user inputs and send them to a server and database. The database should keep the history of user inputs. The server will also send back to the client the history of to-dos. The database will update its state and the client will render it to the DOM. Users will have the ability to toggle to-dos as complete and delete them.

## Usage

1. Enter a to-do into the input field and click 'Add' to add a to-do.
2. A list of to-dos will be displayed below.
3. To mark a to-do as complete, click on the to-do.
4. To mark a to-do as incomplete, click on the to-do.
5. To delete a to-do, click on the X to the right of the to-do.

## Built With

Visual Studio Code, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Express, and Postgres
